Yo guys,

first of all i want to thank you all for 25,000+ soundcloud followers and over 10,000 facebook likes and for the all support trough the last years.

It really means a lot to me and i'm really speechless,i achieved something i dreamed about just few months ago.

Here is my first sample pack,finally (lel),and i really hope you're gonna like it.
It contains the samples and presets i've been collecting,sampling and receiving as gift from other producers.

I'll start making some tutorials on youtube and using twitter to share some tips and tricks,i'm also posting previews of my new stuff on my snapchat too,so be sure to follow me there as well.

I hope you all will achieve your goals in 2017,
much love,Galwaro.
